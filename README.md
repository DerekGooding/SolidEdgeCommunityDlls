# SolidEdgeCommunityDlls
This is just a file dump for the two SolidEdge community DLL files I've updated to .netcore / .Net6 / .Net7


Add this as a nuget package with:

```bash
dotnet add package SolidEdge.Community.Net9
```
Or via the NuGet Package Manager:

```bash
Install-Package SolidEdge.Community.Net9
```
